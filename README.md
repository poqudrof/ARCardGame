# ARCardGame
With ARCardGame you can create Augmented Reality instructions for Card Games or any set of texts.


The first game using this is a card game to teach maths to middle school. 
The game has a board, cards, and the augmented reality part provides additional content: 
- A hint on the answer. (text)  
- The answer. (text )
- Additonal media content (audio). The media content is the question spoken. 

## The project

The project is a java-based Android application. 
It does not include fancy 3D graphics, and provides an «as simple as possible» interface.

### Wait, is this augmented reality ?

## Context 

The project has been running since early 2020. It is motivated to power an AR card games 
called Joue-Maths-Gie that was created by middle school students (11 ~ 14 years old).   
This game can be played without the augmented reality. 

#### Project beginning 

The first contributions were made during a last master’s project at Bordeaux University. The students 
were graduating in computer science, a degree focused on Image and Sound and Mixed Reality. 
(FR details: Master Image & Son de l’Universté de Bordeaux, projet de fin d’étude de Master2)

Their first goal was to validate the assumptions on how to find the card, identify them and 
validate the use. 

#### Maturation and aplha 

After this period a second wave of development focused on improving the user interface. 
A secondary goal was set to simplify the codebase, clear out the less important features 
and prepare for an alpha version.
